# Stitcher

*This project is an active Work In Progress*

## Project Motivation
I like to crochet, I do not like having to manually keep track of my projects. For one project I generally have several links, stitch counts, and notes. Organizing these components require two or more apps and chrome, or a folders worth of paper, and flipping between these apps or papers while actively crocheting is annoyingly finnicky. <br/> </br>
I've tried existing apps, but they still aren't exactly what I wanted. So, I am working on this app to finally put all these project details into one place where they can be used simultaneously and seamlessly

## Current Features
- Lists of Projects
  - Each project has stitch counters and urls
  - Each project has a status, and the projects are sorted by status
- Stitch counters
  - Stitch counters have names, a current count, and a goal count
- URLs
  - Urls can be opened in app
  - When opened in app, a stitch counter can be overlayed on the website so that users don't have to flip between the counter and the project
  - When a Stitch Counter is open on top of a URL, the Stitch Counter can be incremented or decremented with a tap and it will turn green once the goal count has been reached

 ## TODO Features
 - Add the ability to keep notes for each project
 - Improve the UI
